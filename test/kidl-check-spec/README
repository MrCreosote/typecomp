This directory contains files needed for testing the kidl-check-spec script (which indirectly tests the type compiler as well).

You can add new tests simply by putting new spec files in the good-specs or bad-specs directory.  As expected,
good-specs must pass the kidl-check-spec script, whereas bad-specs must fail.

The KSaplingDBD.xml file is used because it is valid to use CamelCase in method names and typedefs that otherwise
have to be lowercase_with_underscores if the CamelCase term references a typed object, Entity or Relationship name.
This file is passed as input to tests.


To run tests, from the root typecomp directory, either

1) run all tests, which include this set
    make test

2) run just this set of tests
    perl test/02test-kidl-check-spec.t
