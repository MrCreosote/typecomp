This directory contains tests of the kidl-check-spec script (which indirectly tests the type compiler as well).

You can add new tests simply by putting new spec files in the good-specs or bad-specs directory.  As expected,
good-specs must pass the kidl-check-spec script, whereas bad-specs must fail.

The KSaplingDBD.xml file is used because it is valid to use CamelCase in method names and typedefs that otherwise
have to be lowercase_with_underscores if the CamelCase term references a typed object, Entity or Relationship name.
This file is passed as input to tests.


To run tests:

    perl run-test.t
